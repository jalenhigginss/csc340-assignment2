            <h2>Gojo Satoru</h2>
            <p><strong>Aura Level:</strong> Infinite</p>
            <p>The honored one himself. His aura is so dense it literally stops things from touching him. Maximum efficiency farming.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Madara Uchiha</h2>
            <p><strong>Aura Level:</strong> 99,999</p>
            <p>Showed up to a war alone just to ask if the clones wanted to use Susanoo. Peak "main villain" energy.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Aizen Sosuke</h2>
            <p><strong>Aura Level:</strong> Calculated</p>
            <p>Stopped the protagonist's theme music with one finger. Insane aura from him right there.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Hisoka Morow</h2>
            <p><strong>Aura Level:</strong> Menacing</p>
            <p>An aura so creepy it physically paralyzed rookies. He doesn't have your "typical" aura, it's just the most sinister, diabolical lust he has that sets him apart from everyone else.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Eren Yeager</h2>
            <p><strong>Aura Level:</strong> Global Threat</p>
            <p>From the start it was him who made everything happen, made the entire world tremble; a villian and a best friend, one of the most conflicting and misunderstood characters of all time.</p>
