            <h2>Aura Breakdown</h2>
            <p>Gojo Satoru is the gold standard for Aura Farming. Everyone in the <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> verse knows of him, and anytime he is mentioned they start glazing him. His aura is "Infinite" and much deserved because of how good he is.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Aura Feats:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Blindfold:</strong> Wearing a blindfold because you are "too strong" is insane aura.</li>
                <li><strong>The Domain Expansion:</strong> "Infinite Void" is his well known ult, one of the most devestating moves in his arsenal.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> When asked if he would lose, he simply said "Nah, I'd win" not much needed to be said, Gojo is just that guy.</li>
            </ul>
