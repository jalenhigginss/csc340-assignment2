            <h2>Aura Breakdown</h2>
            <p>Madara is one of those characters whose hype builds up over time. Since the start of the <em>Naruto</em> show, his name is being mentioned time and time again. Being referred to as a legend shinobi, one of the most feared ever.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Aura Feats:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Battlefield Dominance:</strong> Madara Uchiha's aura is defined by his entrance into the Fourth Shinobi World War. This is the first time he has ever been seen after being reanimated and you can just see the fear in those soldiers eyes. And he didn't just fight that entire army, he literally "danced" through it using only basic combat because why waste your energy on these weaklings? +10,000 aura</li>
                <li><strong>The Susanoo Flex:</strong> One of the greatest aura moments in history occurred when Madara asked the five strongest leaders of the world if they wanted his clones to use Susanoo. He really treated that situation like childsplay.... he proceeded to let all five clones use Susanoo.</li>
                <li><strong>Planetary Scale:</strong> Madara doesn't just fight people; he fights the world. By pulling two meteors out of the sky back-to-back, he showed that his aura extends to the "heavens" themselves.</li>
            </ul>
