            <h2>Aura Breakdown</h2>
            <p>Hisoka farms aura through sheer unpredictability and fear. His "Bungee Gum" possesses the properties of both rubber and gum, but his true power is the amount of fear he puts inside you, just by him looking and you, it's a feeling that is so sinister and perverted, honestly one of the sickest auras known to man.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Aura Feats:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bungee Gum:</strong> His "Bungee Gum" (which has the properties of both rubber and gum) allows him to stand back and fight using his ability without even physically doing anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Warfare:</strong> Unlike the others, Hisoka’s aura is creepy and unsettling. He radiates a bloodlust so thick that it can physically paralyze those who aren't prepared for it.</li>
                <li><strong>The Magician’s Trick:</strong> Hisoka treats every fight as a performance. He will allow himself to be injured just to make the eventual "reveal" of his victory more dramatic.</li>
            </ul>
