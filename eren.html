            <h2>Aura Breakdown</h2>
            <p>From a loud kid into a silent, unstoppable force. His aura peaked when he told his enemies he was simply "moving forward" until they were all gone.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Aura Feats:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Great Shift:</strong> Eren Yeager’s aura shifted between seasons like night and day. He transformed from a hot-headed kid into a cold, calculated menace to society.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rumbling:</strong> Eren’s aura represents the inevitable end of the world. He commands hundreds of thousands 60 meter tall Colossal Titans to walk across the globe and wipe out 80% of humanity. He has seen every alternate reality and unfortunately this is the only outcome he has seen actually make a change for the betterment of his friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom at All Costs:</strong> Eren's aura is rooted in his obsession with freedom. He is willing to become the villain of the entire world if it means his people can live. That level of commitment to a dark path creates a menacing, tragic aura that is unmatched in modern anime.</li>
            </ul>
