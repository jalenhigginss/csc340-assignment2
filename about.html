            <h2>What is Aura Farming?</h2>
            <p>
                In the world of anime and modern internet culture, "Aura" represents the unquantifiable 
                presence, prestige, and "coolness" a character radiates. Aura Farming is the act of 
                performing high-prestige actions like walking away from explosions or standing 
                motionless while an army charges at you to increase your social standing.
            </p>

                This website was developed as a prototype to categorize the most legendary 
                Aura Farmers in history. From the calculated silence of Aizen Sosuke to the 
                overwhelming confidence of Gojo Satoru, we track the shifts in the "Aura Market."
